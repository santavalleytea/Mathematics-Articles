# Mathematics-Articles

## Introduction
This repository is a collection of Mathematics Papers that I wrote up for fun. I am by no means an experienced or trained researcher, thus the papers are written in a more 
casual and approachable tone. The main purpose in writing these papers comes from my interest in mathematics and how it ties in with other fields. There are, however, papers
that are purely mathematical with little to no connections to other fields such as Physics, Computer Science etc. though I still try to incorporate some applications.
All the images and animations (if included) are generated by me using Python or other languages if required.

1. **[The Paradox of Pi](The%20Paradox%20of%20Pi/)**: Exploring the irrationality of Pi and how it ties its infinite representation to the finite world.
